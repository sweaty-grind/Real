# Real

As you can tell.  i am a little reluctant in what i say here.  cause its all illegal.  i gave you the map a while ago dude.

so things were a system of a down and i sorta didn't really enjoy it that i tell you to hurry up.  i wonder though, if this thing is supposed to last forever like this???  i dont know bro.  it sucks.  i think i'm a good person i hope.

but for real???  you guys don't see my neutral position?? even though it does so much damage.  and then you realize that i was managing this shit for free.  cause i have an oath to keep safe everyone i felt deserved it...  which is anyone until you have to play smarty and not appreciate too much foreigners...  you know???  what i really think of this place is a little wonkers. i can't fathom it like my head hurts from usage.  it doesn't feel pain but it feels stress... i wonder if i had to tell you that or you could have figured this out by now...

so yeah...  i feel your stupidity will get me in trouble in the future.  cause you do the wrong things and think there is some sort of safety net for this shit.  i dont know bro. its a little annoying.  oh well imma cut this short cause my head ain't firing off anymore properly.

so i may be sitting on a gold mine with golden eggs.  i dont know man.  this is mega stupid i can't believe the sum of torturing me to death was this stupid shit we have right now.  i dont know man, i feel this has too much self sacrifice for the garbage you do with my information.  why am i still doing this thing when we dont' do shit anymore.  just this stupid long drawn  out crap fest...

so i may want to kick you out of our dealings in the future.  you suck as this aspect.  it will cost you cause i dont run things for free in here especially with your stupid ass.  i told you you had to  do the thingies... but you don't....  something about being a liar without saying a word.

so yeah, i want to exit this project we are doing.  it blows you waste my days until i smash some glass.  and that's after i leave this place...  i dont know bro.  you ask too much i can't provide.  this shark is already on his last legs with me.  i dont know why you are here to be a cunt i'm serious.
