# Real

As you can tell.  i am a little reluctant in what i say here.  cause its all illegal.  i gave you the map a while ago dude.

so things were a system of a down and i sorta didn't really enjoy it that i tell you to hurry up.  i wonder though, if this thing is supposed to last forever like this???  i dont know bro.  it sucks.  i think i'm a good person i hope.

but for real???  you guys don't see my neutral position?? even though it does so much damage.  and then you realize that i was managing this shit for free.  cause i have an oath to keep safe everyone i felt deserved it...  which is anyone until you have to play smarty and not appreciate too much foreigners...  you know???  what i really think of this place is a little wonkers. i can't fathom it like my head hurts from usage.  it doesn't feel pain but it feels stress... i wonder if i had to tell you that or you could have figured this out by now...

so yeah...  i feel your stupidity will get me in trouble in the future.  cause you do the wrong things and think there is some sort of safety net for this shit.  i dont know bro. its a little annoying.  oh well imma cut this short cause my head ain't firing off anymore properly.
